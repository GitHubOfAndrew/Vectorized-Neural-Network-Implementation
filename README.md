# Vectorized-Neural-Network-Implementation

As the title suggests, we will be attempting to vectorize a neural network's training loop. We may end up exploring more implementations of other neural network architectures (CNN, RNN, etc.) but we only have the MLP ANN for now.

**Update 1: The training loop is fully vectorized for any batch size. The validation inferencing at the end of each epoch needs some more work.**
