# Vectorized-Neural-Network-Implementation

As the title suggests, we will be attempting to vectorize a neural network's training loop. We may end up exploring more implementations of other neural network architectures (CNN, RNN, etc.) but we only have the MLP ANN for now.

**Update 1: The training loop is fully vectorized for any batch size. The validation inferencing at the end of each epoch needs some more work.**

**Update 2: The training loop is batched correctly now. The validation inferencing is also done correctly, and it outputs the correct metrics as well. We will likely extend this work into the general case of multiple hidden layers.**
